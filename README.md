OK!!! so a game. Guess the number. 
Server randomly generates a positive number in some range like 1 - 100. All clients try to guess what it is.The server gives one hint about the number to start with. When a client guesses incorrectly the server will give them information about the number. No client can guess twice.  If they guess correct number with at most all clients guessing then the clients win otherwise they lose. Losing takes clients to a losing screen and then winning takes them to a victory screen. After a game the server makes up a new number.
